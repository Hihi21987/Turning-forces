# Turning Forces Simulator
## This is a simple simulation of moments that can be used for teaching, inspired by phet simulations.

# Features
* Draggable weights
* A see-saw to balance
* Sliders to affect other forces (gravity and friction)

# How to use
Just drag a weight to a joint on the see-saw and press start!
